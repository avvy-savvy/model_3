# model_3

Model 3 integrates forecasting data, observation data, and stational weather data to predict avalanche events specific to a given location. By combining these three sources of information, the model aims to provide highly localized avalanche risk assessments, offering a comprehensive understanding of the current conditions and the likelihood of avalanche events occurring at a particular spot. This approach enables individuals and authorities to make informed decisions and take appropriate safety measures tailored to the specific location's avalanche risk.
